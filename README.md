# K Pop Quiz (Client)
My friend asked me to make a game that would show you 2 KPop stars. All you had to do was vote if they were the same or not.

This is the client side of this idea. It was made in Unity in tandem with the server in just over 4 hours.

The goal of this project was to learn how to use a web server to transmit images and data to Unity. This project is never going to be released to avoid the legal implications.
